# Striver's SDE Sheet

This repo contains all the solutions of Striver's SDE Sheet.

The solutions are the most optimized and were written in such a manner to help me revise whenever needed.
Each solution took hours to arrive at and the final ones are the best and the most optimized ones, taken from striver himself or my codes if I arrived at it. :(
